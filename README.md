### red space core game logic

Red space is based off of what I have started with another game idea called "roots and wings" the best example of which is so far the code I have at my [mf_rwcore](https://github.com/dustinpfister/mf_rwcore) project. 

In red space the focus is on the enemy unit AI, and the increased enemy difficultly as you move away from the home location that I have come to call the "wings" aspect of the game. There is no game mechanic for the roots aspect, apart from the safe home location.
