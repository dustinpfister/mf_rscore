# mf_rscore

Red space is a game in which enemies become more difficult as you move away from the home location. Don't get lost, you will regret it if you wonder to far away. Killing enemy's awards skill points that can be used to buy power ups, and returning to the home location will restore your hp half way.

### red space background

Red space is based off of what I have started with another game idea called "roots and wings" the best example of which is so far the code I have at my [mf_rwcore](https://github.com/dustinpfister/mf_rwcore) project. 

In red space the focus is on the enemy unit AI, and the increased enemy difficultly as you move away from the home location that I have come to call the "wings" aspect of the game. There is no game mechanic for the roots aspect, apart from the safe home location.


## About this 'mf_' project

mf_rscore.js makes up the core game logic of the game I have come to call red space. It is part of my "mf_" series of projects that I have been making lately that serve as my vanilla js way of getting things done with game dev.

This project makes use of;
* [mf_shell](https://github.com/dustinpfister/mf_shell)
* [mf_canvas](https://github.com/dustinpfister/mf_canvas)
* [mf_vp](https://github.com/dustinpfister/mf_vp)
